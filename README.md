# -Multi-Honeypot-Platform
Enhanced cybersecurity posture by deploying the T-Pot multi-honeypot platform on Azure Cloud, configuring virtual machines and networks to simulate attack surfaces, and monitoring malicious activity to analyze threats and improve incident detection capabilities.

Using T-pot to create a virtualized honeypot on Azure

Technologies used:
- Microsoft Azure
- Telekom Security's Tpot honeypot

In short, a honeypot is a mechanism used to detect, deceive, or gather information about unauthorized access attempts or malicious activities on computer networks or systems. 
The purpose of a honeypot is to divert and distract attackers from the actual target systems, allowing security professionals to observe and analyze their techniques, motivations, and objectives. By closely monitoring the activities within the honeypot, security professionals can gain insights into the attackers' methods, tools, and vulnerabilities they exploit.

Given my interest in cybersecurity, I was naturally curious about how attackers in the real world might attack a system in the wild and decided to find out first hand. I used Azure so spin up a VM for safety (no "real"/ procuction system would be put at risk) and Telekom Security's Tpot honeypot to act as an irresistible  target (https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce).
