# -Multi-Honeypot-Platform
Enhanced cybersecurity posture by deploying the T-Pot multi-honeypot platform on Azure Cloud, configuring virtual machines and networks to simulate attack surfaces, and monitoring malicious activity to analyze threats and improve incident detection capabilities.

Using T-pot to create a virtualized honeypot on Azure

Technologies used:
- Microsoft Azure
- Telekom Security's Tpot honeypot

In short, a honeypot is a mechanism used to detect, deceive, or gather information about unauthorized access attempts or malicious activities on computer networks or systems. 
The purpose of a honeypot is to divert and distract attackers from the actual target systems, allowing security professionals to observe and analyze their techniques, motivations, and objectives. By closely monitoring the activities within the honeypot, security professionals can gain insights into the attackers' methods, tools, and vulnerabilities they exploit.

Given my interest in cybersecurity, I was naturally curious about how attackers in the real world might attack a system in the wild and decided to find out first hand. I used Azure so spin up a VM for safety (no "real"/ procuction system would be put at risk) and Telekom Security's Tpot honeypot to act as an irresistible  target (https://github.com/telekom-security/tpotce). 

 ## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Steps

### 1. Installing PuTTY for SSH Access
![PuTTY Installation](https://github.com/rakshitbhari/-Multi-Honeypot-Platform/blob/4d9c36f8c7f09a63b0e34f9dcb7314e166b20290/Images/1.png)
PuTTY is a free and open-source SSH client used to access the T-Pot honeypot server remotely. It helps establish a secure terminal connection between the local machine and the Azure-hosted VM.

### 2. Microsoft Azure Homepage

During the VM setup, the image **Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS - x64 Gen2** was selected. This OS provides a secure and updated environment ideal for deploying security tools like T-Pot.

### 6. Azure Deployment in Progress
![Deployment In Progress](https://github.com/rakshitbhari/-Multi-Honeypot-Platform/blob/6ba5b5fa9eada639dfce855008f3860e0f9ae734/Images/6.png)  
After initiating the virtual machine creation, Azure shows the status as "Deployment in progress" under the resource group `RG-Honeypot`. This ensures all configuration steps are being processed.

### 7. Deployment Completed Successfully
![Deployment Complete](https://github.com/rakshitbhari/-Multi-Honeypot-Platform/blob/6ba5b5fa9eada639dfce855008f3860e0f9ae734/Images/7.png)  
The Azure portal confirms that the VM deployment is complete. This status indicates that the virtual machine is now ready for further configuration and SSH access.

### 8. VM Overview with Public IP
![VM Overview](https://github.com/rakshitbhari/-Multi-Honeypot-Platform/blob/6ba5b5fa9eada639dfce855008f3860e0f9ae734/Images/8.png)  
The virtual machine is now running and accessible. The assigned public IP address `20.93.68.74` allows remote SSH connections, which is critical for installing and managing T-Pot honeypot services.

### 9. Network Security Group Overview
![Network Security Group](https://github.com/rakshitbhari/-Multi-Honeypot-Platform/blob/b344025fb1e3138f547801a799e41f407cd2948a/Images/9.png)
This shows the main Network Security Group (NSG) configuration for the HoneyPot virtual machine. The NSG named "HoneyPot-nsg" is attached to network interface "honeypot215_z1" and provides essential network traffic control.
